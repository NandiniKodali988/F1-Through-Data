# Introduction

Formula 1 (F1) is widely regarded as the pinnacle of motorsport, where cutting-edge technology, driver expertise, and strategic decision-making converge to create one of the most intricate and competitive sports globally. Spanning diverse circuits across the world, each Grand Prix epitomizes engineering excellence, precise strategy execution, and split-second decisions that often determine success or failure. The ultimate goal for teams and drivers each season is to secure the World Drivers' Championship (WDC) and World Constructors' Championship (WCC), where fractions of a second can be the difference between winning and losing.
A team or driver's success in F1 is influenced by several interdependent factors:

- Driver Skill and Adaptability: A driver's ability to adjust to changing race conditions, car dynamics, and strategic demands is vital.
- Constructor Performance: The technical prowess of the car, including aerodynamics, power unit optimization, and tire management, plays a significant role in determining outcomes.
- Circuit Features: Each track is unique, defined by characteristics like track length, number of corners, straights, and the percentage of time drivers spend at full throttle, all of which affect race strategy.
- Pit Stop Strategy: Fast and efficient pit stops are critical for success, helping drivers maintain competitive positions or gain an edge over rivals through well-timed stops.
  
In F1, data analysis is just as vital as the skill of the driver or the technological advancements of the car. During a race, teams collect vast amounts of data, monitoring key parameters such as tire wear, fuel consumption, aerodynamic efficiency, lap times, and pit stop durations. These data points offer opportunities to optimize car setups, refine race strategies, and predict future outcomes. However, integrating and analyzing these factors collectively remains a complex challenge, providing a rich foundation for data-driven research.

This project harnesses Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and machine learning techniques to identify relationships hidden within F1 racing data. By exploring driver performance, constructor success, pit stop efficiency, and circuit characteristics, this research seeks to uncover insights into how strategy, engineering decisions, and team execution collectively influence race results.

# Research Questions

1. How does a driver's performance evolve when they switch teams, and what role do constructors play in shaping their success?
2. Can patterns or trends in pit stop data reveal insights into team strategies and race outcomes?
3. Can data-driven models predict race outcomes, such as point finishes, podium placements, or race wins, based on race and pit stop data?
4. What influence do pit stop duration, frequency, and timing have on overall race success for drivers and teams?
5. Are certain circuit types, like high-speed tracks or technical layouts, better suited to specific constructors?

# Literature Review

There is a limited body of research focused on Formula 1, with most studies concentrating on technological advancements in motorsport racing. However, a few notable works provide unique insights into the sport. For instance, research has explored topics such as determining the greatest driver of all time [@eichenberger2009best], analyzing the impact of teams selling their technology to competitors on overall performance [@aversa2015business], and examining how environmental changes influence team performance[@marino2015driving].
