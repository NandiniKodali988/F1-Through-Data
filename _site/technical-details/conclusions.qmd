Can patterns or trends in pit stop data reveal insights into team strategies and race outcomes?
Can data-driven models predict race outcomes, such as point finishes, podium placements, or race wins, based on race and pit stop data?
What influence do pit stop duration, frequency, and timing have on overall race success for drivers and teams?
Are certain circuit types, like high-speed tracks or technical layouts, better suited to specific constructors?
