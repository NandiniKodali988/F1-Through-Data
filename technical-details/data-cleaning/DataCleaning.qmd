# Introduction
Raw data collected from various sources is rarely in a format ready for analysis. It often contains inconsistencies, missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant information, which can hinder the analytical process and lead to inaccurate or biased results. **Data Cleaning** is the process of transforming this messy data into a structured, consistent, and reliable format, suitable for extracting meaningful insights and applying models effectively. 

**Importance**:

-	Data cleaning ensures that the data is complete, accurate, and consistent, significantly enhancing the reliability of insights derived from the analysis and the performance of models built using the data. High-quality data forms the foundation of robust models and predictions.

-	Missing values in the dataset can introduce bias or distort the analysis. Addressing these gaps through techniques like **imputation** (filling in missing values using statistical or logical methods) or **removal** helps maintain the integrity of results.

-	Duplicates in the dataset can overrepresent certain patterns, while outliers may distort metrics and affect model accuracy. Identifying and appropriately handling these anomalies ensures the analysis remains valid and unbiased. 

-	When data is collected from multiple sources, differences in format, naming conventions, and measurement units can cause inconsistencies. Standardizing these elements across all datasets ensures that the data can be seamlessly integrated and analyzed as a whole. 

**In this project**:\
Data was collected from a variety of sources, Data Cleaning was an essential step. Each raw dataset underwent a tailored cleaning process designed to fit its specific structure and use case. These processes will be discussed in detail within the respective sections dedicates to each dataset.
