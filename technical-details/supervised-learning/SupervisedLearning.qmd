# Introduction

Supervised Learning is a branch of Machine Learning where models are trained on labeled data. The primary goal of supervised learning is to learn a mapping function that can predict outputs for unseen data accurately. This approach relies on historical data to identify patterns and relationships, enabling it to generalize well on new, unseen data.

**Process**:

-	The model is provided with input-output pairs from historical data. Each data point consists of:
    - Features (X): Independent variables or predictors.
    - Labels (Y): Target outputs or dependent variables.
-	The model learns the relationship between the input features and corresponding outputs using a loss function that measures prediction error. The goal is to minimize this error.
-	Once trained, the model can predict outputs for new inputs.
-	Performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score for classification tasks, or RMSE, MAE for regression tasks.

**Types of Supervised Learning**

1.	Classification:

-	The goal is to categorize inputs into discrete classes or categories.
-	Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

2.	Regression:

-	The goal is to predict a continuous output based on input features.
-	Algorithms: Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Ridge and Lasso Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR).

**Challenges**:

-	Supervised learning requires large volumes of labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to obtain.
-	Models may memorize training data instead of generalizing to new inputs. Regularization and cross-validation techniques help mitigate this.
-	In  classification problems, imbalanced classes can affect performance.

**In this project**:

Supervised Learning Algorithms are applied to classify race results and predict pit stop duration.
